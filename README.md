Kaggle Piracy Movies dataset Viz and Analysis

# Welcome to Piracy Website Analysis!

Piracy movies have become a cultural phenomenon in many parts of the world. The act of illegally downloading or streaming movies has become normalized among certain groups, who view it as a way to access content that may not be readily available or affordable through legal means. Some even see it as a form of rebellion against the corporate control of the entertainment industry. The proliferation of piracy has led to a complex web of ethical, legal, and economic issues, with some arguing that it harms creators and the industry as a whole, while others see it as a way to democratize access to culture. Regardless of one's stance, it is clear that piracy movies have become an enduring part of modern popular culture. This is why I decided to come with a trend chart for how long before a movie is posted online.

We will be looking at a dataset that has been scraped from a piracy website like Soap2day , HD2day. Its important to understand that none of these piracy websites do have their very own servers and they do not collect and store movies in to their server, they are just utilizing an existing server.
